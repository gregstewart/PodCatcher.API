MANDY:  Hey everybody and welcome to episode 138 of the Ruby Rogues podcast. Today, I am your host, Mandy Moore, otherwise known as Ruby Rep, otherwise known as the Rogues assistant. Today, I will be giving you a very special and hopefully hilarious glimpse into the Ruby Rogues Retreat in which I had the pleasure, or misfortune, of attending this past July after the LoneStar Ruby Conference.

We rented a house in Austin, Texas, which was basically a mansion and holed up for four days so the Rogues could discuss their boring book stuff and I could eat all their food and record super-secret conversations in a very James Bond-esque manner. A great time was had by all and no one died, though David came close and we went our separate ways still friends. I made it on and off an airplane, which was a huge win for me, though Katrina tried to get me to stay on the streets of Austin for an extra month by booking my return flight for August 24th instead of July.

Alas, all worked out and I got to come home to my daughter whom I lovingly refer to as chicken, and my four cats, two dogs, three hopelessly lost men, and a very, very dirty kitchen. When I got home, I had over 24 hours’ worth of audio to go through, a lot of which were the sounds of James’s wife, Dana, cooking amazing meals in the kitchen, which was not so easy on my ears. But I managed to get around Dana’s kitchen drum solos to gather some good content. All in all, the Rogues were good to me and treated me like the princess that deep inside I know I am.

DAVID:  Oh my god, I love your hair!

MANDY:  [Chuckles] I did look pretty good that day. But while I was being treated like a princess, there was another one giving birth.

MANDY:  Oh, Kate’s giving birth.

JOSH:  Yeah, I heard. She went into labor.

MANDY:  No she, he’s arrived.

JAMES:  It’s here?

JOSH:  Is it human?

JAMES:  Is it human? [Chuckles]

JOSH:  You never know with the British Royals.

MANDY:  It’s a boy. It’s a boy.

MANDY:  And in typical Avdi fashion, he just didn’t get it.

AVDI:  Why is this royal baby the top news?

JAMES:  I don’t know. Because it’s the royal baby, Avdi.

MANDY:  Though everyone there was obviously not as concerned at pop culture and royal babies as I was, we still managed to have fun. And David continued to be David.

DAVID:  I just realized, I kind of want to troll exercism the way we donkey-punched the, or donkey-patched, excuse me…

[Laughter]

JOSH:  Excuse me.

[Laughter]

CHUCK:  Hey everybody and welcome to episode 136 of the Ruby Rogues podcast. This week on our panel, we have James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  Good morning everyone.

CHUCK:  Katrina Owen.

KATRINA:  Good morning.

CHUCK:  Josh Susser.

JOSH:  Good morning from San Francisco where it’s 85° out today.

CHUCK:  I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.TV. I&#039;m just going to give a quick reminder. You got two and a half weeks to get the 1/3 off on Rails Ramp Up, if you want to sign up.

We also have a special guest this week and that’s Steven Proctor.

STEVEN:  Howdy from Dallas-Fort Worth.

CHUCK:  You want to introduce yourself, Steven?

STEVEN:  Yeah. I&#039;m a Ruby immigrant. I have been spending most of my time in .NET up until about the past year when I got laid off. Sent an email out to the Ruby user groups in the area and got picked up from someone taking a chance at someone on someone who’s got development experience but has only played with Ruby. So, I&#039;m currently at Simplify and doing Ruby and some Erlang here as well.

JAMES:  Cool.

JOSH:  Hey, good morning everyone.

CHUCK:  Avdi Grimm.

AVDI:  Hello from Pennsylvania.

CHUCK:  James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  Good morning everyone.

CHUCK:  I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.TV. And I just want to let you know I’m going to do Rails Ramp Up again. Sign up by the beginning of the year. I’m doing a 30% discount and I will probably never do that again. So, if you want in, get it now. We also have a special guest and that’s Ilya Grigorik.

ILYA:  Hey everyone. I’m glad to be here.

JOSH:  Hey, welcome to the show.

CHUCK:  I asked you before the show and I still probably slaughtered your name.

ILYA:  No, that was good. That was right.

CHUCK:  Yehey! [Chuckles] So, since you haven’t been on the show before, do you want to introduce yourself?

JOSH:  And keep it up.

JOSH:  He’s cheating on us with another podcast.

DAVID:  I’m not taking him back.

JAMES:  [Chuckles] You say that every time, David.

DAVID:  I know. I know. I know. [Laughter]

BEN:  From a tiny little, barely relevant podcast.

JAMES:  [Laughs]

CHUCK:  Yeah, it’s the same name as the blog, right? Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots?

BEN:  It is. That’s right. We only have the ability to come up with one good name after a few years.

JOSH:  Chuck, you have to say it with the voice.

AVDI:  Yeah, you have to say, ‘Giant Robots’.

CHUCK:  Hey everybody and welcome to episode 128 of the Ruby Rogues podcast. This week on our panel, we have Avdi Grimm.

AVDI:  Hello. And since Josh has helped me achieve enlightenment, I will now be known as Baba Ram Dig Vim.

[Laughter]

JAMES:  I’m not saying that throughout this entire episode.

CHUCK:  Josh Susser.

JOSH:  [Chuckles] Hi from San Francisco. And Avdi, it’s about time I was getting tired of calling you ‘Your Worship’.

AVDI:  [Laughs]

CHUCK:  David Brady.

DAVID:  My code has an inferior Ruby complex. Can we do something about that?

CHUCK:  Katrina Owen.

KATRINA:  Hello from Denver.

CHUCK:  James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  I got nothing.

[Laughter]

CHUCK:  I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.TV. A quick reminder: go check out GoingRogueVideo.com for my video on how I went freelance. And we also have a special guest this week and that’s Avdi Grimm.

AVDI:  Baba Ram Dig Vim.

[Laughter]

DAVID:  Can I just call you Baba? There’s [inaudible] Mr. Vim.

JAMES:  I am for him correcting us for the entire episode.

[Laughter]

JOSH:  I’m going to call him Baba Dig Vim.

[Laughter]

AVDI:  Just to let everybody on the joke. Josh pointed out that Ram Dig Vim is an anagram of my name. And so apparently, according to my name, I have secret Vim tendencies.

CHUCK:  [Laughs]

JOSH:  What’s in a name?

JAMES:  Yeah. We always knew that. We knew before you knew, Avdi. Relax.

[Laughter]

JOSH:  That’s always the case.

CHUCK:  Oh, no! This is going to be one of those episodes, isn’t it?

JOSH:  Yeah. So,</itunes:summary>

CHUCK:  [Laughs] I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.TV. Before I introduce our special guest, I want to just briefly make a quick announcement and that is this Friday is my Freedom Day. It’s the day that I got laid off three years ago and I am celebrating that. I&#039;m celebrating my freedom by putting out a free video that kind of talks about the first year or so that I was freelance, how I found clients, how I got started, how I put my business together, all that kind of stuff. So, if you&#039;re interested in that, you can get it at GoingRogueVideo.com. Anyway, like I said, it’s free. So, just go and hopefully it helps some folks out who are interested in going freelance.

Anyway, our special guest this week is Charlie Nutter.

CHARLIE:  Hello there, everybody.

JOSH:  Hi Charlie.

CHUCK:  Charlie, you haven’t been on the show before. Do you want to introduce yourself really quickly?

CHUCK:  Hey everybody and welcome to episode 123 of the Ruby Rogues Podcast. This week on our panel, we have James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  You all make me want to program wet and naked.

CHUCK:  Nice. Avdi Grimm.

AVDI:  Hello.

CHUCK:  I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.TV. And we’ve got a special guest and that is Piotr Solnica.

PIOTR:  That was very good. Hey everyone. I’m Piotr.

CHUCK:  I was just thinking it rhymed with pizza.

PIOTR:  [Laughter]

CHUCK:  Alright, well do you want to just explain who you are and what you’ve done?

PIOTR:  Okay, sure. I’m a software developer from Poland. I live in Kraków. I’m mostly a Ruby developer. I’m also doing some frontend work from time to time. People probably know me from a project called DataMapper and now it’s called Ruby Object Mapper. So this is my biggest priority in open source right now. And yeah, that would be it, probably.

JAMES:  So DataMapper is dead? Just kidding. Just floating [inaudible] rumors there.

[Laughter]

PIOTR:  That’s a hard question.

[Chuckles]

CHUCK:  So are you not following the DataMapper pattern anymore? Or did you just feel like it was time to refresh?

JAMES:  Actually, it’s the other way around, isn’t it?

PIOTR:  Yeah, it’s the other way around. We basically started with DataMapper as the project name. However, it implements active record pattern, which is funny. Eventually, we decided to rename the project Ruby Object Mapper because we didn’t actually like having the project called by the pattern itself. So the first project called DataMapper, as I’ve said, is an implementation of active record.</itunes:summary>

KATRINA:  Can you say, “I believe I broke his jaw”?

KENNETH:  Who, me?

KATRINA:  Yes, you. Of course, you.

KENNETH:  I believe I broke his jaw.

KATRINA:  Ah! It’s so brilliant.

JAMES:  Okay, now you have to explain that.

[Laughter]

KATRINA:  I think at the first Mission Impossible movie, there are some really bad guys from South Africa and one of them says, “I believe I broke his jaw,” and it’s so funny.

[Laughter]

CHUCK:  Okay.

CHUCK:  Hey everybody and welcome to episode 121 of the Ruby Rogues podcast. This week on our panel, we have Avdi Grimm.

AVDI:  Hello!

CHUCK:  Josh Susser.

JOSH:  Good morning.

CHUCK:  Katrina Owen.

KATRINA:  Hello.

CHUCK:  James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  Good morning.

CHUCK:  I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.TV. And this week, we have a special guest, Adam Keys.

ADAM:  Hello there.

CHUCK:  You’ve been on the show before, Adam. Do you want to introduce your self anyway?

ADAM:  Sure. I&#039;m Adam, I&#039;m from Texas. I currently work at LivingSocial and work on Sifter app on the side. I&#039;ve only been a consultant for like four months of my life. So, there.

CHUCK:  [Laughs] Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

ADAM:  It was a discovery process. I learned that I liked just working on a product more than doing all the other things that consulting work entails.

JAMES:  That’s kind of funny actually. I was wondering if you were going to say it was the worst four months of your life. But for me, I think it’s almost backwards, like I love the constantly seeing new things and stuff like that. So, I never feel like I&#039;m bored and stuff.

JOSH:  Hey, maybe we can start with a definition. Like, what is a consultant?

JAMES:  What is a consultant? Yes.

JOSH:  What do you mean by ‘consultant’?</itunes:summary>

JAMES:  Alright. So, what are we talking about today?

JOSH:  It’s hard to say.

JAMES:  It’s hard to say.

CHUCK:  Hey everybody and welcome to episode 120 of the Ruby Rogues Podcast. This week on our panel, we have David Brady.

DAVID:  All programs halt. Computer science is a fraud.

CHUCK:  Josh Susser.

JOSH:  My introduction is NP-complete.

CHUCK:  James Edward Gray.

JAMES:  I am made of lambda calculus.

CHUCK:  And I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.TV. We have a special guest this week and that is Tom Stuart.

TOM:  Hello from sunny London.

JAMES:  That’s not true. I’ve been to London.

DAVID:  What?

[Laughter]

CHUCK:  I was going to say.

JAMES:  I don’t buy that.

TOM:  It is a beautiful day in London today.

JAMES:  What? There were no beautiful days. I was there for half a month. [Chuckles]

TOM:  Got to plan ahead.

CHUCK:  Yeah.

[Laughter]

CHUCK:  You have to be there.

DAVID:  [inaudible] doing a podcall.

JOSH:  Okay, let’s not do a podcast about weather.

[Laughter]

JOSH:  How are you doing, Tom?

TOM:  I’m good, thanks. How are you?

JOSH:  Could use more sleep, but I’m feeling great.

CHUCK:  Since you’re new to the show, Tom, do you want to introduce yourself really quickly?

TOM:  Yeah. My name is Tom Stuart. I’m a Ruby on Rails developer and freelancer and I just wrote a book. I think that’s probably what we’re going to talk about today.

CHUCK:  Probably.
